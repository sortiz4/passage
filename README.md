# Passage
Passage is an offline password generator with a variety of options and a
striking visual feedback system that alters the color scheme of the interface
based on user selections, providing intuitive visual cues about password
strength and complexity. Users can also generate multiple passwords
simultaneously and save them directly to a text file for enhanced privacy,
eliminating the need for visual or clipboard transmission of sensitive
information.

## Compilation
Those seeking to compile must have...

- Node.js 22.0

Once these requirements have been met, simply clone the repository and execute
`npm install` to download the project's dependencies, and `npm run build` to
compile the project. Once completed, the `apps/client/out` directory can then
be deployed to any web server.
